# Agro-Food-C02-emission_EDA

The Dataset includes information about Temperature increase and an extensive list of features that represent the emissions coming from different activities of the agri-food sector. The aim of this project is to investigate the relationship between those features and temperature increase.

In doing so, an extensive exploratory data analysis will take place, as well as a correlation analysis and null values handling.

Bellow are all the variables included in the dataset:

Savanna fires: Emissions from fires in savanna ecosystems.

Forest fires: Emissions from fires in forested areas.

Crop Residues: Emissions from burning or decomposing leftover plant material after crop harvesting.

Rice Cultivation: Emissions from methane released during rice cultivation.

Drained organic soils (CO2): Emissions from carbon dioxide released when draining organic soils.

Pesticides Manufacturing: Emissions from the production of pesticides.

Food Transport: Emissions from transporting food products.

Forestland: Land covered by forests.

Net Forest conversion: Change in forest area due to deforestation and afforestation.

Food Household Consumption: Emissions from food consumption at the household level.

Food Retail: Emissions from the operation of retail establishments selling food.

On-farm Electricity Use: Electricity consumption on farms.

Food Packaging: Emissions from the production and disposal of food packaging materials.

Agrifood Systems Waste Disposal: Emissions from waste disposal in the agrifood system.

Food Processing: Emissions from processing food products.

Fertilizers Manufacturing: Emissions from the production of fertilizers.

IPPU: Emissions from industrial processes and product use.

Manure applied to Soils: Emissions from applying animal manure to agricultural soils.

Manure left on Pasture: Emissions from animal manure on pasture or grazing land.

Manure Management: Emissions from managing and treating animal manure.

Fires in organic soils: Emissions from fires in organic soils.

Fires in humid tropical forests: Emissions from fires in humid tropical forests.

On-farm energy use: Energy consumption on farms.

Rural population: Number of people living in rural areas.

Urban population: Number of people living in urban areas.

Total Population - Male: Total number of male individuals in the population.

Total Population - Female: Total number of female individuals in the population.

total_emission: Total greenhouse gas emissions from various sources.

Average Temperature Â°C (target) : The average increase of temperature (by year) in degrees CelsiuS.

In the notebook I will perform:

Exploratory data analysis:
Understand the relationship between Temperature rise and CO2 emmission derriving from the agri-food sector activities.
Extensively investigate the relationship amongst an extensive list of agri-food processes CO2 emmisions and average temperature rise.
Identify any potential correlations between the agri-food sector emmissions and average temperature increase.

Data Preprocessing:
Deal with missing values
Split the data in a train, validation and test set
Data normalization
Feature engineering
